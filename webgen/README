description:
  This skeleton of a webgen website provides a set of default files for every
  created webgen website.

  When using the standard settings, the sources are in the directory `src` and
  the generated output goes into `out`. Extensions can be placed under `ext`.

  For configuration purposes, use the config.rb or config.yaml files.

Prerequisites:
Webgen is known to work with: Ruby 1.8.6 and RubyGems 1.3.4
If you have an older version of RubyGems (check by running 'gem --version'), you can 
upgrade it by running:
  
    sudo gem install rubygems-update
    sudo update_rubygems
    
You may also need to clear out your previously installed gems.  On OSX, you would run:

    sudo rm -Rf ~/.gem /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/*

Installing:

    sudo gem install webgen coderay feedtools haml RedCloth
    sudo gem install --source http://gems.github.com FooBarWidget-mizuho

Configuring:

 * edit the src/metainfo file to change the variables to your project specific values
   (such as the project name, source code locations & JIRA etc)
   
 * edit Rakefile to specify the project id (lower case) which is used for deploying the site

Generating the site:

    webgen
    open out/index.html

Auto mode:

    rake auto
    
will run webgen in auto mode where it will auto-detect changes in the source files and 
regenerate the site automatically for you.


Cleaning up:

    rake clobber
    
Deploying:
    
* to be able to deploy the site you will need to install sitecopy

    sudo port install sitecopy  

* to deploy the site run

    rake upload
