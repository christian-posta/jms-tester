# How to get {project_name:} up and running
Do you really want to execute it ?

--- name:content pipeline:tags,textile

h2. Installing {project_name:}

*Required:*
* You need a the binaries for {project_name:}. Either you have "built":{relocatable: building.html} yourself from the sources or 
  you have "downloaded":{relocatable: download.html} a distribution archive.
* Java 1.5

The first step for the installation is to unzip the {project_name:} archive into a directory of your choice, let's say **JMSTESTER_HOME**.

h2. Additional libraries

We use "Hyperic's Sigar library":http://www.hyperic.com/products/sigar.html to realise operating system level probes. The distribution files already contain
the necessary classes to leverage *Sigar* in the *jmstester-sigar* library. You need to download and the *sigar* binaries and copy them accordingly. 

Once you have downloaded the sigar binaries, unzip them into a directory of your choice, let's say **$SIGAR_HOME**. Then copy the required libraries 

{coderay:: plaintext}
cp $SIGAR_HOME/sigar-bin/lib/* $JMSTESTER_HOME/lib
{coderay}

We use "RRD4J":https://rrd4j.dev.java.net/ to create the metric graphs for the benchmarks. You must download the sources of RRD4J and build it with 
a JDK 5 or higher. Once you have done that, you will find a *rrd4j-2.0.6.jar* in the rrd4j lib directory. You must copy that jar file into the {project_name:}
lib directory.

{coderay:: plaintext}
cp $PATH_TO_LIIB/rrd4j-2.0.6.jar $JMSTESTER_HOME/lib
{coderay}
