# Source Repository

If you are new to Git you might like to try the [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

The Git repository is here:

* **git://forge.fusesource.com/{project_id:}.git**

You can [browse the repository online](http://fusesource.com/forge/gitweb?p={project_id:}.git;a=tree) if you prefer.

    git clone git://forge.fusesource.com/{project_id:}.git
    cd {project_id:}

## Committer access

Project members who have configured a public SSH key in their [user profile](http://fusesource.com/forge/users/edit_self) can push to the repository using the following URL:
