# How it works
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
The *{project_name:}* documentation and site is created using [WebGen](http://webgen.rubyforge.org/) and is stored in git in the same [source control system as the code](source.html)
</div>

# Editing the source code
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
If you [grab the source code](source.html) you can get the site source in the *webgen* directory.
If you have webgen installed (see below for instructions) then you can build the website from [the code](source.html) as follows

    cd {project_id:}/webgen
    webgen
  
If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

    webgen
    
You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

If you are on OS X then we highly recommend [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) as a great editor which supports Textile and Markdown

# Editing the site in your browser
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
The generated HTML has a link at the bottom of the page to <b>Edit This Page!</b> as well as supporting the [Universal Edit Button](http://universaleditbutton.org/) if your browser supports it. There is also a link to the page source if you are wondering where it is kept in subversion.

If you use FireFox you might want to install the [Edit Page Plugin](https://addons.wikihow.com/univedit.xpi)

This feature depends on having a restful resource which will accept posted changes to the page.
