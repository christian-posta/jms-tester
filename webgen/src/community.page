# Lets Talk
The {project_name:} community is here to help you

--- name:content
We really want you to get involved in the {project_name:} and we love [contributions](contributing.html). One of the easiest ways to get involved is to join the community discussions.

# Developer Mailing List

The developer list is used for general discussions and ideas about the code and how to use it.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">To subscribe:</th>
    <td><a href="mailto:{project_id:}-dev-subscribe@fusesource.org">{project_id:}-dev-subscribe@fusesource.org</a></td>

    <td><a href="mailto:{project_id:}-dev-unsubscribe@fusesource.org">{project_id:}-dev-unsubscribe@fusesource.org</a></td>

# Commit Mailing List

The commit list is notified of all changes to the source code or changes to [issues](support.html) so you can use this list to watch development and support occur.

<table cellspacing="10">

    <td><a href="mailto:{project_id:}-commits@fusesource.org">{project_id:}-commits@fusesource.org</a></td>
